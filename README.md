# 🐱🐶 Cat vs Dog Image Classification (Deep Learning)

This project focuses on building a **Cat vs Dog image classification model** using **Deep Learning**. The entire work was done in **Google Colab**, covering data loading, preprocessing, model training, and prediction.

> ⚠️ Note: This project **does not include a website or deployment**. It is a **model-building and experimentation project** intended for learning and showcasing Computer Vision skills.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to classify images into two categories: **Cat** or **Dog** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. The model is trained on labeled image data and tested on unseen images to evaluate its performance.

This project helped me understand the **end-to-end workflow of a Computer Vision model** in a notebook-based environment.

## 📊 Dataset

* Image dataset containing two classes: **Cats** and **Dogs**
* Images were resized and normalized before training
* Dataset was loaded directly in **Google Colab**

*(Dataset source can be Kaggle or a custom image folder)*

---

## 🏋️ Model Training

Steps followed in Google Colab:

1. Imported required libraries
2. Loaded and preprocessed image data
3. Built CNN architecture
4. Trained the model on training data
5. Evaluated model performance
6. Saved the trained model

The trained model is saved in **`.keras` format** for reuse.

---

## 🔍 Predictions

The model can predict whether a given image is a **Cat 🐱** or a **Dog 🐶** after preprocessing the image in the notebook.

---

## 📌 Key Learnings

* Image preprocessing for Deep Learning
* Understanding CNN architecture
* Training and evaluating binary classification models
* Using Google Colab for ML experimentation

---

## 🔮 Future Scope

* Improve accuracy with data augmentation
* Hyperparameter tuning
* Convert model to TensorFlow Lite
* Deploy the model using **Streamlit or Flask** in the future
